Use tools only.
1) Call the read tool on webwrapper-eval/tmp/large-diff/large.txt with offset 0 and limit 5. Do not read further.
2) After you receive the file contents, call the edit tool to replace:
oldString: "line 1\nline 2\nline 3"
newString: "line 1 updated\nline 2\nline 3"
Do not call edit in the same response as the read.
